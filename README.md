# LGMVIP-DataScience
##### As a part of datascience internship, we deal with several steps which are as follows:
##### Step1: Import all the necessary libraries to your jupyter notebook or google colab.
##### Step2: Load the data and read the file which may be in .csv, .txt, .json etc format.
##### Step3: Perform data preprocessing for the data (pre-processing may include hadnling null values etc)
##### Step4: Perform data visualization and draw inference for the plots you recieve
##### Step5: Draw the ultimate conclusion of the entire project which must be accurate enough which is primary task of a data scientist.
